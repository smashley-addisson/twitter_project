    # It has to be run only once.
* python manage.py db migrate
    # Generate new migrations in the 'migrations' folder
    # The file is pre-filled based on the changes detected by alembic, 
    # Edit the description message at the beginning of the file and make any change you want.
* python manage.py db upgrade
    # Implements the changes in the migration files in the database and updates the version of the migration in the alembic_version table.
